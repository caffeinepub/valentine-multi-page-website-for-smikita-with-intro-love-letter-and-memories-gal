  "summary": "The diff adds a new third step (LovePicturesStep) and updates the App navigation to a 3-step flow (Intro → Love Letter → Love Pictures) with a reset button back to Intro. However, the required static image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated/ are not evidenced in the diff summary, so the image-asset requirement is not fully verifiable/implemented from the provided changes.",

      "requirement": "Add the required love-themed images as generated static assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` with the exact filenames specified, and render them from `/assets/generated/*` paths.",
      "reason": "The new LovePicturesStep references the required `/assets/generated/*.png` paths, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`, so the acceptance criterion that the files exist with exact filenames is not met based on available evidence.",
